Pros :
1. Display is above exception. It looks like a amoled display colorwise.
   This one I found out really great.
2. Boot up time is : max(12 sec).
3. Fingerprint : max(less than 1 sec).
4. Backlit keyboard looks really nice.
5. Battery backup is around 5-6 hours (at least for now).
6. Keyboard is also really good.( May be keyboard is looking really nice to me because before this the keyboard on HP was really bad , but I never feel like it that was bad but now after using it I can see the difference , and its huge ).
7. It is really light weight (1.41 kg).

Cons : 
1. Camera is not as good as I expected.
2. 256 gb SSD , it should be 512.
